# 🐭️ MouseHunt - No Sidebar

A Userscript for [MouseHunt](https://mousehuntgame.com) that hides the sidebar and moves it into a tab in the top menu.

> [!TIP]
> You should install [MouseHunt Improved](https://github.com/MHCommunity/mousehunt-improved) instead of this script, as it includes this functionality and tons more!


## Installation

Install via [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/449491-mousehunt-no-sidebar).
